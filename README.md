Ever wondered what the probability of you drawing into your colours is?

# IMPORTANT REGARDING USER-AGENT:

Moxfield has locked their API access to whitelisted user-agents only,
which means you'll have to request one for yourself.

The user-agent can be defined in the user_agent.py file.

Run main.py and you will be prompted with several questions.

Give the tool a Moxfield link and specified mode(s).

This tool has several limitations:
- It is capable of playing lands only.
- It will draw only one card per turn.
- Number of draws <=> lands played <=> turn count.
- The result isn't very accurate because it does only 1000 simulations.
- It fills colours in wubrgc order which means it makes mistakes sometimes.
