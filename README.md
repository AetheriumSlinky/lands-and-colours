Ever wondered what the chances of you drawing into your colours is?

Run main.py and you will be prompted with several questions.

Give the tool a Moxfield link, specified mode(s) and watch the reaallly slow simulation happen.

This tool has several limitations:
- It is capable of playing lands only.
- It will only draw one card per turn.
- Number of draws <=> lands played <=> turn count.
- The result isn't very accurate because it does only 1000 simulations.
- It fills colours in wubrgc order which means it makes mistakes sometimes.
